<font color = blue>The show the office is a great show to share with people because it can make
anyone laugh and is enjoyable for any age. The humor, while different from any
other show you might see, is unique and interesting. Although the show isn&#39;t for everyone, at least give it a try and it might surprise you how much you enjoy it!<br></font>
Here&#39;s some iconic moments from the show:<br>
<center> <font color = green> Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.<br>
That&#39;s what she said<br>
I&#39;m not superstitious but I am a little stitious<br>
Did I stutter<br>
You miss 100% of the shots you dont take. -Wayne Gretzky - Michael Scott<br>
Dwight you ignorant slut!<br>
I want people to be afraid of how much they love me<br>
How the turntables...<br>
If I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice<br>
Occasionally, I&#39;ll hit somebody with my car. So sue me.</font><br> </center>
